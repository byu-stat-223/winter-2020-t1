STAT 223 coding standards:

1. Use consistent indentation for code bodies, etc.

2. Use gets operator "<-" instead of equals operator "=" for assignment.

3. One space on either side of " <- " operator.

4. Use 'for (..." instead of 'for(...'. Same for 'if' and start of functions.

5. Use vectorization whenever possible.

6. Use TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.

7. Favor sapply function over 'for' loop for simple problems.

8. R scripts should be run correctly from a clean R environment with the current working directory being the directory containing the script.

9. Use meaningful variable names.

10. Load packages at the start of the script using the library function.

11. Avoid "hard coding" the same value in several places; instead set a variable once and use the variable in the place of hard coded values.

12. Avoid copying and pasting large sections of code; instead write a function that carries out operation.
