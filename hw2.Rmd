repository for homework 2.

+ Once your repository is created, create a new RStudio project based on that
repository.

## Collect All Four

Some brands of cold cereal run promotions in which one of four free toys
is included in the cereal box. The company encourages consumers to "collect all
four." The typical approach is to buy one box at a time and stop as soon as the
set is complete. Consider two scenarios: 1. That each toy is equally likely,
and 2. That toys have selection probabilities 0.10, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.40. Write
an R script or RMarkdown document named `all-four.R` (or `all-four.Rmd`) which 
conducts a Monte Carlo simulation study to answer the following questions under 
the two scenarios:

  * What is the mean number of boxes that a consumer must purchase to get a complete set?
  * What proportion of consumers will need to purchase 14 boxes or more to complete a set?

In answering the questions, **be sure to assess the Monte Carlo error
(through, for example, a confidence interval)**. Your script should run in less
than about 30 seconds. Use good coding standards, such as proper indentation
and good variable names. Make your script reuse as much code as possible, as
opposed to having virtually-duplicated code with only minor modifications. Make
sure your code clearly labels and displays the results rather than just
printing out numbers. Note that, in this problem, the number of items in the
set is 4. The best solution is general for any number of items in the set, that
is, it is best if the code can handle selection probabilities vectors of
arbitrary length. Summarize your results in a file called 'memo.txt' that would
be appropriate to share with your boss who doesn't know R.


## Birthday Problem

The [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) is
described in [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).  Briefly, it concerns the
probability that, among n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have
the same birthday.  For simplicity, ignore the possibility of leap day
(February 29). In a script named `birthday.R` or `birthday.Rmd`, write an R 
function called `birthday` that takes two arguments: `n` (a numeric vector of 
length one giving the number of people) and `n_reps` giving the number of replications
for the simulation study.  The function should return a numeric vector of length 
three giving a Monte Carlo estimate and a 95% confidence interval on the probability.

Plot your Monte Carlo estimates of this probability (on the y-axis) as a
function of n (on the x-axis) using a solid black line.  With dashed lines,
show the lower and upper bounds of your 95% confidence intervals.  With a red
line, show the true probability based on the formula for the Wikipedia article.
Your plot should look like [this](birthday.pdf) (subject to Monte Carlo error).
Do not submit your plot as part of the homework, but do submit the R code that
produces your plot.
