```

+ Make sure your laptop is setup (install git, R, and RStudio). Follow 
instructions outlined [here](setup.html).

+ Use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/M-BYd6tr) to create your hw1
repository on GitHub

+ Without changing the names, add all the files in [this
repository](https://github.com/byu-stat-223-master/hw1-starter) to your HW1 
repository.

+ Modify the R scripts to produce the requested results.  Remember to use the
[coding standards](coding-standards.html).

+ In a script named `fib.R`, write an function named `fib` whose sole input is
an integer (say `n`) and whose output is a vector containing the first n
Fibonacci numbers (every number after the first two is the sum of the two
preceding ones and the first two numbers are 1).

+ Commit your work to your HW1 repository and push these updated files to
your online GitHub repository. **Remember that HW is not submitted until it is
successfully pushed to GitHub.**
